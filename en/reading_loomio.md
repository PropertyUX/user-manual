# Navigating Loomio

The sidebar is where you will find your discussions and your groups. It is displayed by default on large screens, and collapsed by default on small screens (such as smartphones), but can be toggled via the bars icon in the navigation bar. The navigation bar also features the search field, your notifications tray and your user menu. 

## Viewing your threads and groups

### Recent Threads

The **Recent Threads** page gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. You can access this page via the **Recent** option in the sidebar. If you are a member of multiple groups the **Recent Threads** page will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio.

The **Recent Threads** page displays content from your groups in a prioritised list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity; **Today**, **Yesterday**,** This month**, **Older than a month**.

If a thread or proposal title is **bold** then new activity has taken place since you last visited. Numbers in parentheses reflect how many new comments or votes have been posted since you last visited a particular thread. Decisions will show a graphic representation (a pie graph for proposals, bar charts for other poll types), with your position on the proposal superimposed on the graph. If you havenâ€™t yet stated a position, there will be a question mark.

### Unread Threads

The **Unread Threads** page shows all threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can access this page via the **Unread** option in the sidebar. You can clear unread items without reading them by hovering over the thread preview and clicking **Dismiss**.

### Muted

The **Muted** page displays all threads you have previously muted. It can be accessed via the **Muted** option in the sidebar. Muted threads do not appear on your **Recent** or **Unread** pages.  You can mute a thread by hovering over the thread preview on the group page, **Recent Threads** page, or **Unread Threads** page, and using the **Mute** button.

### Viewing your groups

All the groups you belong to are listed in the sidebar. If you are only a member of only one Loomio group, the home page for this group will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio. If you have multiple groups you can easily navigate between them from using the sidebar.

### Exploring public groups

You can explore, and request membership to, public Loomio groups by visiting the **Explore** page. The **Explore** page is accessed via the **Explore public groups** option in the sidebar.

## Searching for content, accessing your notifications and user menu
