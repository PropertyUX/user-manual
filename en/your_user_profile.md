## Updating your profile info

### Uploading a profile photo
When you first create a Loomio account, your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. You can upload a profile photo by clicking **Change picture** in the **Picture** section of your profile page. If you have a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/ "opens in new tab") you can set that as your profile picture by selecting **Use Gravatar**.

### Update your personal info

You can update:
* your name, 
* your username (your username is the name people will use to mention ([@mention](comments.html#-mentioning-group-members "opens comment section of the help manual") you in comments),
* your email address,
* your introduction (a few lines to let other members know more about you),
* your location (this might show a location based on your log-in information, but you can delete or replace it with the indication you want).

## Language settings
Loomio is developed in English, but [is translated by volunteers in many languages](https://www.loomio.org/g/cpaM3Hsv/loomio-community-translation). It will detect your browser’s preferred language settings, but you can manually set your preferred language by visiting your [profile page](#your-user-profile "Opens user profile section of the help manual") and selecting your language from the **Language** dropdown.

Once your info is completed, click on the **Update my profile** button.

## Setting or changing your password
If you are logged in to Loomio you can change your password by visiting your profile page and clicking **Change your password**. If you are logged out then you can visit the [**Forgot your password?**](https://www.loomio.org/users/password/new "opens in new tab") page.

## Deactivating your account
If you are not the sole coordinator of any groups you can deactivate your account by visiting your profile page and clicking **Deactivate account**. If you are the sole coordinator of a group you will be prevented from deactivating your account until you’ve [appointed another group coordinator, or archived the group](coordinating_your_group.html).

Once your account has been deactivated:

* you will no longer be listed as a member of any groups
* comments, proposals and discussions you’ve made will remain but your name will be removed from them
* you will no longer receive Loomio-related emails
* you will need to [contact us](https://loomio.org/contact "opens in new tab") to reactivate your account
