# Keeping up to date

## Notifications

In the [navigation bar](reading_loomio.html), the Bell icon will show all activities in threads you've started or participated in and all @mentions. Just click on one of them to see details or participate.

## Email settings

Your email settings control how much you hear from a Loomio instance, from a group or from a specific discussion thread. There are three settings for each of these scopes. Please note that you can reply directly to any comments you receive via email and your replies will be posted in the Loomio thread, without having to log in Loomio.

### Global email settings

There are three email options applying to your account on Loomio, which can be edited in your **Email settings** in the user menu.

* **Daily summary email**: Enabling this setting means each morning you will get an email with any activity that you missed the day before. This email provides an easy routine for staying up to date with Loomio activity.
* **Subscribe on participation**: Enabling this setting means when you participate in a thread, all further activity will be emailed to you immediately.
* **Mentions**: Enabling this setting means when someone wants to get your attention, they can @mention your name in a comment, which will notify you. We recommend you leave this setting on, so you'll get an email when this happens.

### Group email settings

You can also fine-tune these choices by changing your email settings for a group, open the **Options** dropdown on the group page and select **Email Settings** from the menu or access your **Email settings** in the user menu to act on your default settings or review each group settings.

For each group you're a member of or for every group you'll join in the future, you can choose from the following settings:

* **All activity**: You will be emailed whenever there is activity (comments, votes, new threads, proposals, and proposal outcomes) in this group.
* **Important activity**: You will be emailed about new threads and proposals (i.e. when a proposal is started, about to close or when a proposal outcome is created). **Important activity** is the default for new groups. You can read about changing the default email settings for new groups in the **Updating email settings for all groups** section below.
* **No emails**: You won't be emailed about activity in this group: you'll have to log-in and check new group activity on your [**Unread**](reading_loomio.html#unread-threads "goes to reading Loomio section of the help manual") and **Recent** pages.

You can also apply a particular setting to all of your groups by checking **Apply this setting to all my groups**.

### Thread email settings

When you start a new thread, it will inherit your email setting for its group. To change your email settings for a thread, open the thread options dropdown and select **Email settings** from the menu.

* **All activity**: You will be emailed whenever there is activity (comments, new proposals, votes and proposal outcomes) in this thread.
* **Important activity**: You will be emailed when a proposal is started, about to close or when a proposal outcome is created.
* **No emails**: You won't be emailed about this thread.

In order to apply a particular setting to all threads in a group, check the **Apply this setting to all threads in this group** checkbox before submitting the form.

If you have muted a thread you won't be notified about proposals, or any other activity taking place in the thread, unless someone @mentions you. You can read more about muting threads in [**Navigating Loomio**](reading_loomio.html#muted-threads "goes to reading Loomio section of the help manual").
