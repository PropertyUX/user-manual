# Loomio GDPR compliance

This page describes Loomio's handling of your personal data in the context of the [EU GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/).

Loomio has done a full internal review of how we handle personal data in the context of the GDPR. We only use or share personal data where users have given permission to do so, and we have verified all the third parties and Data Processors that we engage with are also committed to compliance with the GDPR.

## Loomio Cooperative is a Data Controller
The Loomio Cooperative Limited operates www.loomio.org as well as a number of private hosts for our clients, these are each known as Loomio _instances_.

Loomio is application software for people to have discussions and to make decisions together. Personal data is collected and processed to serve this purpose. You may refer to our [terms of service](terms_of_service) and [privacy policy](privacy_policy) for more information.

Additionally, Loomio is open source, free software available from our Github repository. There are many independent instances of the Loomio software running which the Loomio Cooperative is not the data controller and takes no responsibility for.

Each instance of the Loomio is a separate system. Consent to store and process personal data is handled instance by instance.

## Data Protection Officer

Loomio has appointed Robert Guthrie as the DPO for Loomio Cooperative. Enquiries and requests can be made via email: dpo@loomio.org.
