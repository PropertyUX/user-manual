### Standard Plan ($19/mo)
#### Subgroups

<img class="screenshot" alt="add subgroup animation" src="add-subgroup.gif" />

Loomio, in the Gold and Pro plans, allows you to create subgroups within your groups. Subgroups let you break your group up into different teams. Loomio subgroups can contain members of the parent group and people who donâ€™t belong to the parent group. Depending on your [group settings](group_settings.html "goes to group settings section of the help manual"), subgroups can be created either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only.

To add a subgroup, select the **Add subgroup** option from the **Options** menu on your group page.

To visit your subgroup settings page, click the **Options** button on the group page and select the **Edit Group Settings** option from the dropdown menu.

Subgroup settings are the same as [group settings](group_settings.html "goes to group settings section of the help manual"), but with additional privacy settings.

There is also an additional privacy option related to the subgroup's discussion privacy. The "Members of *parent group* can see private threads" option of the **Advanced settings** section, allows you to choose whether you want discussions to be accessible to members of the parent, or to members of the subgroup only. If you choose to make the subgroup accessible to parent group members, but the discussion threads accessible to members only, then members of the parent will be able to access the subgroup's page, but not access any of the subgroup's threads.

#### Slack integration

You can connect Loomio groups (or subgroups) to the Slack channel of your choice. Once set up, activity in Loomio will trigger notifications in Slack, such as new discussions and proposals.

To set up your Slack integration, please contact us and we'll guide you through the process.

#### Custom Domain
Make your Loomio group easy to find and share with a custom URL like *mygroup.loomio.org*. 

To set up your custom domain, please contact us with your desired address and we'll set it up for you.

### Pro Plan ($99/mo)
The Pro Plan includes everything in the Standard Plan, above, plus more, for up to 10 groups.

#### Premium Support
Email contact@loomio.org at any time, or click 'Contact Loomio' in the app.

#### Help with Initial Setup
We'll have a meeting or video call with you to support your group to get started, advise on starting your initial discussions, and answer any questions.

#### Analytics Reports
Quantitative intelligence about participation in your group. To get an analystics report, contact us and let us know which stats you're interested in.

#### Data Export
A full download of your group data, for analysis or archiving. Get in touch and let us know your preferred data format.

## How to upgrade to a premium subscription

### Our group has no money! Can we still use Loomio?

Yes. You can choose the Free plan (see our [Pricing](http://loomio.org/pricing "opens pricing page in new tab") page for details).

### We haven't decided which plan suits us yet, can you help?

Just email [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org "opens in new tab") and we will help chose the right plan for your needs.

### How does the Free plan work?

The Free plan includes all the core functionality of Loomio, with unlimited users. Your members will be occasionally asked for a voluntary donation. Free plans do not include [Premium Features](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/manual/content/en/premium_features.html).

### How can we select a paid plan?

If you are in a Free plan and want to upgrade, select the blue Upgrade Plan button on your group's main page and choose one of our paid plans from the chart.

### What credit cards do you take?

Visa, Mastercard and American Express.

### Are you GST-registered?

Yes we are. In New Zealand GST is added to the price for all paid subscriptions. GST is not added to donations.

### Can I get an invoice?

When you first set up a subscription you will get an email from Chargify, our payment processor, with the subject line **[Loomio] Manage Your Subscription**. That will include a link to log in to your billing portal, which will let you download statements.
