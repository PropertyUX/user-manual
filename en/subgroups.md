# Subgroups

<img class="screenshot" alt="add subgroup animation" src="add-subgroup.gif" />

Loomio, in the Gold and Pro plans, allows you to create subgroups within your groups. Subgroups let you break your group up into different teams. Loomio subgroups can contain members of the parent group and people who donâ€™t belong to the parent group. Depending on your [group settings](group_settings.html "goes to group settings section of the help manual"), subgroups can be created either by everyone in the group, or by coordinators only.

To add a subgroup, select the **Add subgroup** option from the **Options** menu on your group page.

## Subgroup privacy

To visit your subgroup settings page, click the **Options** button on the group page and select the **Edit Group Settings** option from the dropdown menu.

Subgroup settings are the same as [group settings](group_settings.html "goes to group settings section of the help manual"), but with additional privacy settings.

There is also an additional privacy option related to the subgroup's discussion privacy. The "Members of *parent group* can see private threads" option of the **Advanced settings** section, allows you to choose whether you want discussions to be accessible to members of the parent, or to members of the subgroup only. If you choose to make the subgroup accessible to parent group members, but the discussion threads accessible to members only, then members of the parent will be able to access the subgroup's page, but not access any of the subgroup's threads.
